In summer the locals leave and tourists come in Barcelona. Literally everyone from barcelona don't want to be there during the season. A lot of offices were even closed.

It got super warm, temperatures reaching high 30s. Similar to the Philippines except less humid.

Also that summer didn’t go well with the job hunting.
