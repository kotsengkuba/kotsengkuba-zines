## Tourists go

…home!

In summer the locals leave and tourists come in Barcelona. Literally everyone from barcelona don't want to be there during the season. A lot of offices were even closed.

That summer didn’t sync well with the job hunting.

Also, it got super warm, temperatures reaching high 30’s. Similar to the  philippines except less humid. I wonder if this is a recent phenomenon, of extreme changes brought about by the climate crisis.
