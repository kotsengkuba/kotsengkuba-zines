## To be illegal

In these circumstances, in a way, I was “illegal”.

All anxiety is mellowed down by the thought of what’s the worst that could happen. Ok so maybe I get deported.  Besides, I have always been curious if deportation can be my way back home and whether or not it’s going to be a free ride!  I was not in Trump’s America ( well as of writing, I am now), where illegal immigrants are treated way worse.

## Pinoy passport

The Philippine maroon passport looks just like any other passport. The  illustrations inside portraying heritage and biodiversity are actually nice. Other than that, it is sadly one of the weakest passports in the world. 

Each and every visa process is a test of diskarte and patience; a feeling of youth being sucked out of you.

## Reflection as luxury

The mere existence of this “work” is a luxury that needs to be recognized. It is not always that we can make the time and space for reflective activities. Yes it also takes practice and some discipline, but we often take forgranted the environment that can foster it: a safe space/good place, the right mood, not being in a state of fight-or-flight.

Futures-thinking is only available to those not burdened/suffocated by the present or past.
