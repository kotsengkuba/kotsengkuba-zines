# Catalonia

It is easy to remember the provinces of Catalonia. LGBT : Lleida, Girona, Barcelona and Tarragona. I was lucky enough to have visited all of them. What each of the LGBT symbolize for me: 

Lleida - Fear and anxiety of facing reality

Girona - An escape within the escape (with friends)

Barcelona - Where we cook!

Tarragona - A glimpse of a possible future 

## Trip to Tarragona

Our project, Jaleo, has been accepted to the NUBIA LABS residency program in September. One of the first meetings with the organizers and fellow residents was held in Tarragona. And so La Banda went on a field trip!

There we presented our project, met the fellow participant, had food and walked around and explored the streets and nearby sights. At this point in time, I had submitted my application for a new TIE and was just, it was the period of just waiting and manifesting. To me, that trip to Tarragona represented/projected an exciting future. 

## Trip to Lleida

The plan was to apply for the Busqueda de Trabajo residence as a last option. I knew that no one from the same program has successfully done this. Still there was some hope that if we submitted documents issued by Universitat de Lleida, they might be more “legitimate”. UdLis public/official school that will issue our diplomas. In the past years, it was by a different school. By September, with the deadline getting too close, I had to prepare for this application. Receiving no reply from UdL through email, and not getting any valuable response/ action from IAAC, I went to UdL myself. 

To save money, I had booked the 9am train going to Lleida and the 7pm train going back. At 11, I spoke to one of the personnel in the UdL office. I requested the document/any document that proves my study. They couldn’t give me anything because they have not received any updates of student records from IAAC! (So frustrating!) She just told me that she will send me the document via email as soon as they can, with no assurance of when. It was a short discussion as we could not do anything else until they receive word from IAAC. At half past 11am, I left UdL.

I was just in Lleida. With my thoughts. With the realization that nothing is going as planned. With the stress. I’ve spent so much time and energy in this quest to stay and I’m failing. It was the lowest point, where I felt like giving up and going home. It was two days before my birthday. (I guess there is a phenomenon that we tend to be more emotional in birthdays and holidays.) 

I really just want to go back to making cool and meaningful stuff, but life gets in the way.

## Trips to Girona

I was able to go on a couple of trips to Girona with friends. One with the roomies and another with mdef friends. Just chilled out and enjoyed its beauty.
