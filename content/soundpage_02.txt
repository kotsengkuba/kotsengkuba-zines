## La Dinamo

There is one special space called Dinamo Espai, in Nou Barris, my (neighbor)hood for most of my stay. I learned about it from Laura, one of the masters directors. I found the front door where it said “ El capitalismo esta basura, …”.  Went in and met Kike, (one of) the founder(s). Dinamo is a space, a collective, an act of resistance. It’s open every thursday, so I went almost regularly and soon got to know the other frikis there.

D-I-T Do It Together 

Before, I knew nothing about synthesizers. Now, I know a little. 

he openness and the community it fosters. Just people making sound together. 

It is blatantly anti capitalist and anticommercial. 

These are the types of spaces I’d like to build in the future. 

Public pianos. Collectives. Open source. Open spaces. How do we start spaces like this? In a science metaphor, how to lower the activation energy? Maybe it’s just me always looking for free stuff.
