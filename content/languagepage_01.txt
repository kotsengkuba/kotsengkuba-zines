It sucked that I have never taken a foreign language class. Being in a room of people engaged in conversation and not understanding them is weird. I found two options to go about it. First is to  simply disengage, which is easy but kinda feels rude. Second is to genuinely try to comprehend, latch on words that sound familiar, piece them together, keep up with the native talking speed. You fail and consider the first option - until you find a good friend who can translate for you. It gets stressful and tiring but its the kind of stress that you know trains your brain. 

  

## Tagalog

A lot of tagalog words are “loan words” from spanish, apparently around 30% of the tagalog roots words - that’s a couple of thousand. The obvious ones are things/nouns that were literally brought to the country, e.g. table things like cuchara | kutsara, tenedor | tinidor, vaso | baso, etc.

[[Except those who grew up in the tagalog region (around metro manila) like me, many filipinos are trilingual - with their native language plus the required national languages, filipino (= standardized tagalog) and english. I’ve read that the situation is similar for other major dialects in the Philippines]]

Voz = Boses
Vez = Beses 
Chisme = Tsismis 
Hora = Oras 
Demasiado = Masyado 
Basura = Basura
Pues = Puwes
Pero = Pero
Para = Para
Almorzar = Almusal
Guapo = Gwapo
Hermano/a | Manong/Manang

There are also confusing ones with slight semantic changes
Seguro | Siguro
Todo | Todo
Siempre | Siyempre
Sigue | Sige
Vale | Bale
Basta | Basta
Esquinita | Iskinita

Although I was able to survive with english and tagalog and more or less a year’s worth of duolingo, there is a whole world of media and literature that one can access by learning a new language. And obviously, it lets you integrate socially and culturally.

For sure it’s not too late to continue learning castellano (and catalan!). No better time than now.
