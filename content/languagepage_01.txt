## Dos Maneras

Programming languages are easier to learn.

It sucks that I have never taken a foreign language class. Being in a room of people engaged in conversation and not understanding them is weird. I found two options to go about it. First is to simply disengage, which is easy but does feel rude.

Second is to genuinely try to comprehend, latch on words that sound familiar, piece them together, keep up with the native talking speed. You fail and consider the first option - until you find a good friend who can translate for you. It gets stressful and tiring but its the kind of stress that you know trains your brain. 

## Tagalog

I was able to survive with english and tagalog and more or less a year’s worth of duolingo. A lot of tagalog words are loan words from spanish, apparently it is around 30% of the tagalog roots words - that’s a couple of thousand. The obvious ones are things/nouns that were literally brought to the islands, e.g. table things like cuchara | kutsara, tenedor | tinidor, vaso | baso, etc. 

[[Except those like me who grew up in the tagalog region (around metro manila), many filipinos are trilingual - with their 1. native language 2. filipino (== standardized tagalog) and 3. english. I envy their skills too.]]

Examples
Voz == Boses
Vez == Beses 
Chisme == Tsismis 
Hora == Oras 
Demasiado == Masyado 
Basura == Basura
Pues == Pwes
Pero == Pero
Para == Para
Almorzar == Almusal
Guapo == Gwapo

There are also confusing ones with slight semantic changes
Esquinita | Iskinita
Seguro | Siguro
Todo | Todo
Siempre | Siyempre
Sigue | Sige
Vale | Bale
Basta | Basta

Voy a seguir aprendiendo, poco a poco probablemente. Para mi vuelta.
