## About

Here I present snippets of thoughts, memories, reflections about my 13-month trip. Manila to Barcelona and nearby places.  Mostly in english, with little bits of taglish (tagalog + english) and attempts at spanish. 

“para llevar” means “to go” or “for takeout”, usually used when buying food.

## begin();

I started writing and collecting as I welcomed myself to New York city. That past 24 hours had been heavy. 

- to make a bad zine
- to remember - it gets really hard with age
- to make kwento
- to thank all those who have welcomed me in barcelona!

New York has allowed for time and space; distraction, reflection; in calm and chaos - witnessing Trump’s re-election and getting hit by a car!

## Travel

I am not really a traveler. Prior to this trip, I didn’t move a lot. The longest that I’ve been away from home was maybe a month. For me, it is inconvenient and a waste of resources. International travel is just so expensive and requires a ton of paperwork, as I’ll very much point out here. I'd soon realize that there might be things that make it worth it. 

In September of 2023, I came to Barcelona to study in a masters program. 13 months later, I left. Sure, I did what I came there to do: finish my studies, but along the way I thought it would be nice to stay. And I tried to. Just didn’t work out.
