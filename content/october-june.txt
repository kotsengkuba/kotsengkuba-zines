## MDEF

Design for Emer ? what?? It was always tough explaining what the masters is, because for the most part we were confused on what we were or supposed to be doing. In the end, we learn to accept the doubt and freedom the program has allowed and  well, learned to treat it as a playground.

Imagining, making and reflecting on possible futures - what the heck could we make/design with present technology thru small scale design interventions. To avoid redundancy just checkout this documentation minnie-at-iaac.github.com. 

## Nou Barris

For most of the trip, I lived in Nou Barris a.k.a. the hood. Everyday it takes a 30-40 minute ride on the metro, passing thru most of the stops of the yellow line L4. It gets crowded, but not as bad as the mrt (train in manila). It was comfortable enough that could read during the ride. And even sleep! But got very good advise early on that I shouldn’t do so. There are the occasional drunks and pickpockets. Buses are fun too, scenic. The 20 EUR per month card is a good deal.

## IAAC

IAAC, what can I say. It has pros and cons. It is the reason for this entire trip. I applied really early at IAAC, it was part of the strategy of sending out applications to europe and the US first before considering nearer countries. I ignored the acceptance email. If they hadn’t reached out a second time, months later, then I wouldn’t have considered. 

Later on, and upon speaking with other students, I realize the private school/institutions have the incentive to get international students as the fees are higher. But it felt like a disservice that international students go through a lot more. 

I did reach out to officials of the school and they have been kind of  receptive, and I do hope change happens.
