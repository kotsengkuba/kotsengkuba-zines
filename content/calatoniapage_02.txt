## Trips to Girona

I was able to go on a couple of trips to Girona with friends. One with the roomies and another with mdef friends. Just chilled out and enjoyed its beauty.

## Barcelona of course
It is easy to remember the provinces of Catalonia. LGBT : Lleida, Girona, Barcelona and Tarragona. I was lucky enough to have visited all of them. What each of the LGBT symbolize for me: 

Lleida - Fear and anxiety of facing reality

Girona - An escape within the escape (with friends)

Barcelona - Where we cook!

Tarragona - A glimpse of a possible future
