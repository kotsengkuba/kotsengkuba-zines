In 2023 I decided to pursue masters studies abroad. I was curious how design is taught, studied and applied in other places, especially in the “west”/“Global North”. It was also a time when lockdowns were easing up, we had the entire pandemic to re-think and revalue our lives. In 2022, we had just been through the most heart breaking election, Marcos-Duterte are now in power. Thinking of the next six years in this administration was just depressing and was definitely one of the factors why leaving for a while was appealing, freeing. I was thinking any success that I manage to get in the next six years in the country would just give credit to the Marcoses and Dutertes, which I wouldn’t want to give. It felt like an escape. An escape from the circus shitshow of philippine politics, an escape from traffic and responsibilities, an escape from typhoons and disasters.  

This escape comes with some burden of guilt. I am only able to go on this journey with luck and privilege. There is struggle, but nothing compared to those with far less capacity. 

(I should probably end this with something inspiring haha)

## what now

All the future-centered thinking and the revisiting of pasts - from rizal to stories of the amazing people I met in Barcelona, their experiences, ideas, dreams - create new meaning in the present.

This stint in Barcelona (and nearby places) has left me a little less jaded, a little more hopeful. Maybe that’s enough.

Until then
Hasta pronto
