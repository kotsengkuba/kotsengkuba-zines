I am not really a traveler. Prior to this trip, I didn’t really move a lot. For me, travelling is a waste of resources. International travel is just expensive and a lot of paperwork. It still is, as I’ll very much point out here, but even the chance to get something good in return makes it worth it, maybe.
I came to Barcelona to study in a masters program. Not so willingly, I left 13 months later. Sure, I did what I came there to do but along the way I thought it would be nice to stay. And I tried to. Just didn’t work out.
## Flying/Paglipad
Economically, the goal was to find work and earn back all of what I spent in the year. I didn’t have a full scholarship. Tho I got a  percentage of discount (from the “women in tech” fund that the school offered), the base tuition fee for me was the international rate. It was twice the price for locals and 1.x times the rate for students from the EU.
And then there’s the prospect of getting citizenship. It’s like a Kickstarter stretch goal. Being able to stay means working toward a spanish passport. Not to be too dramatic, but it does change the game. You suddenly unlock many borders and free f*cking healthcare for yourself and even for your family! 
From the design/creative practice lens, there was so much more to learn, explore and share in Barcelona. 
Positionality is important here, I have the privilege to go abroad for the “experience”, with ample stability and security. Unlike many filipinos who go as a sacrifice to provide for their families.
There were two instances in airports that really got me nervous. 
((An honorable mention is when back in 2013 I went to HK with my family as there were rumors that those in the DOST program are in the blacklist and cannot go out of the country.))
To start off/recap, the process for students going to and staying in spain is 1) to apply for and get a visa then 2) to apply for and get a TIE (a foreigner identity card). Then, 3) if you want to stay in spain you can “renew”/”re-apply” for another TIE, you are given until 90 days after the TIE expires to apply without needing to leave the country. 
In that in-between, it’s not really allowed to go in and out of the country. But there is also the Schengen Area thing of having open borders within the EU. This is where the grayish area lie. In July 2023, I travelled to France and Italy, to be with family and friends, for fun basically. My TIE expires in the middle of the trip. So  technically, I had no valid document to justify/protect my stay in those countries. I was “illegal”.
I was fully aware of it, had done some research, and asked those I knew who’ve recently travelled. There was a mix of anecdotes, of having IDs checked or not, but there were more of those that were not checked. 
In one local flight in Italy, the airline people were checking the IDs! They checked my visa which they saw was (of course) long expired. I told them I am a student in barcelona as I took my time (pretending) to reach for my TIE (which is a day or two expired). I got the TIE out, showed it from afar, hoping that they would not inspect it. They didn’t, I got thru. This isn’t even one of the two airport instances, but it caused me to be more scared for the next international flights.
The first one is the flight back to Barcelona. The previous flight that checked my visa really got me scared. I was already googling for the trains and buses I could take in case they didn’t let me in the plane. The plane was delayed for more than an hour. When it finally arrived, the passengers and airline personnel were trying to move as quickly as possible. The delay worked in my favor. They didn’t bother to check anything else beside the boarding pass and the name and photo on my passport. 
Second is when I was going out of Spain, to the US. I was given 15 days to leave the country, starting from when the notice came out. I counted and recounted the days and booked the flight on the 14th day, giving myself an extra day as buffer, and maximizing the last days in barcelona.
Going out of barcelona, there’s a police officer (national police, I think) just before you enter the boarding for international flights. I showed my visa and TIE first. Understandably he started to get more serious as these were ofc expired. So I then showed the resolution letter. Took him a while to read it from my phone. That minute or so seemed like forever. Without typing or writing anything down, he then stamped my passport and let me thru. I got an overpriced airport cafe and bocadillo for the last time. 
Entering the US is another thing. I still had to prepare things like considering which point of entry is more lax, having a ticket back home, having my tita write a letter that I’ll stay at her place, and booking tickets for events as proof that I’m just staying for vacation. In the end, the office let me thru, I guess it was not so bad.
In these circumstances, in a way, I was “illegal”.
All anxiety is mellowed down by the thought of what’s the worst that could happen. Ok so maybe I get deported.  Besides, I have always been curious if deportation can be my way back home and whether or not it’s going to be a free ride!  I was not in Trump’s America ( well as of writing, I am now), where illegal immigrants are treated way worse.
The Philippine maroon passport looks just like any other passport. The  illustrations inside portraying heritage and biodiversity are actually nice. Other than that, it is sadly one of the weakest passports in the world. 
Each and every visa process is a test of diskarte and patience; a feeling of youth being sucked out of you.
# Scene 2: Kapwa, Oddkin and the Diaspora
## Diaspora
Millions of Filipinos leave to work or fully migrate to another country, most of them seeking better opportunities. I had always seen it from the POV of staying and seeing how seemingly everyone is leaving. 
The past year has put me in a pseudo state. Being a student is the in-between, a space where one can think and consider staying away. 

The diaspora comes in
~~I cannot look away from the fact that~~ 
I have seen at the most personal level in my life the real struggle of filipinos, especially those I met in spain.
It is difficult to give justice to their long journeys
But to narrate them is maybe a start
In the last two months, I stayed with a filipino couple, Tito and Tita. They have been in spain/eu for more than 20 years now. They arrived from different paths. One was working in the crew of a yacht and the other got the papers because of being petitioned (for years) by their older relative. They worked hard. What is most admirable is that the are so so kind, not just to me but to many others, evidenced by frequent gifts and visits they receive. They gave home to many in the past in their times of need, without asking much in return.
