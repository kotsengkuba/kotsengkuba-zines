## Rice theory

Just something that I saw recently is this research about rice theory, which proposes that growing rice tend to foster a more cooperative and group-oriented culture than growing wheat. 

Strongly proven or not, I like it because I like rice and resonate with this idea.

It was also from this trip that I was inspired to cook, to cook better and to cook for others. Thanks to Jolo, the masterchef housemate.
