## Ube kape

Ube is a purple root crop native to the Philippines, similar to taro. One of my go-to spots is Ube Kape (L’Ube Kape). Jolo discovered it and the roomies (Jolo, Lia and I) would frequently go there. It is a go-to spot of many Filipino students. The cafe not only had great food and drinks but also had a welcoming atmosphere.

Always greeted with a “Kumusta” and smiles that would just make your day a little lighter. My friends and I have been “sukis” (regular patrons) and had gotten to know the owner, Tita Lolit, and one of the baristas, Kuya Charles.

Us roomies coincidentally had the same graduation day so we had a small get together at the cafe with our families. 11 of us filled the tiny interior. 

Top recos are ube latte, ube cake, ube casava, beef sandwich. 

## Pinoy pride

We felt that the L’Ube Kape fam were proud of us.  (Pinoy pride is a weird thing, it can get problematic sometimes) 

Underneath the pride one feels for their pinoy kabayan (of same nation) is the acknowledgement of the struggle. Of how hard it is even just to get by. We celebrate victories and successes as if they were our own. 

We come back to the notion of the struggle, a shared one across countries, of people in the Global South. 

Frustratingly, this is because the cards are stacked against you. The cards brought about by THE SYSTEM, in the Philippines, for me, it’s a combination of historical exploitations, proliferation of corruption and impunity. This feels like something to always be explicit about.
