## Ube kape

Ube is a purple root crop native to the Philippines, similar to taro. One of my go-to spots is Ube Kape (L’Ube Kape). Jolo discovered it and the roomies (Jolo, Lia and I) would frequently go there. It is a go-to spot as well for many filipino students. The cafe not only had great food and drinks but also had a welcoming atmosphere.

Always greeted with a “kumusta” ("how are you") and smiles that would just make the day a little lighter. We have been “suki” (regular patrons) and had gotten to know the owner and their baristas.

The roomies (with Jolo and Lia) coincidentally had the same graduation day so we had a small get together at the cafe with our families. 11 of us filled the tiny interior with chikahan and good vibes. 

Top recos are ube latte, ube cake, ube casava, beef sandwich. 

## Pinoy pride

We felt that the L’Ube Kape fam were proud of us.  (Pinoy pride is a weird thing, it can get problematic sometimes) 

Beneath the pride one feels for their “kabayan” (someone of the same nation) is the acknowledgement of the struggle. Of how hard it is even just to get by. We celebrate victories and successes as if they were our own. 

Coming back to the notion of the struggle.  Can’t help but think it’s always a losing game for those in the “third world”/”developing countries”/”global south” or whatever future term that the others/”global north” decides to call it. The cards are just stacked against us.

## Rice theory

There is a recent research about a so called the rice theory, that growing rice tend to foster a more cooperative and group-oriented culture than growing wheat. [1]

Strongly proven or not, I resonate with the idea, given that I had a fair amount of interactions to feel this pattern and I just really like rice.

It was also from this trip that I was inspired to cook, to cook better and to cook for others. Thanks to the masterchef housemate Jolo.

## Adobo for 20

If I had one proud achievement during the masters, it would be cooking and serving adobo for the ~20 people in our class. We were in  angoustrine, france, where the asian section is a mere single shelf in the grocery, giving an extra challenge. 

Adobo: the unofficial national dish of the philippines and has many variations. Each household would claim that their adobo is the best. 

This one is a simple chicken adobo. Mix vinegar, soy sauce, whole peppers as marinade. Let the chicken cutlets soak overnight. Lightly oil a frying pan. Sear the chicken for around 1 to 2 minutes, just until each one is has some browning. No need to cook it fully at this point. Get a big pot. Lightly fry some garlic, put all the chicken in. Pour in the marinate. Put some bay leaves. Add water until everything is in the liquid. Set fire between low and medium. Cover and let it simmer for at least 40 minutes. Take a piece and check if it's still raw, let it simmer more until otherwise. Taste the sauce and adjust flavor with soy sauce, vinegar or sugar. Remove the cover and let the sauce reduce until whatever thickness you like. Taste and adjust seasoning as you go.

I would happily do this again for them, an amazing bunch of creative people who grew to be my good friends.
