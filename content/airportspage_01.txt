There were two airport instances that got me nervous. 

((An honorable mention is when back in 2013 I went to HK with my family. There were rumors that those in the DOST(Dept. of Science and Technology) program were not allowed to go out of the country.))

## Return to BCN

In one local flight in Italy, the airline people were checking the IDs! They checked my visa which they saw was (of course) long expired. I told them I am a student in Barcelona as I took my time (pretending) to reach for my TIE (which at that time is a day or two expired). I got the card out, showed it from afar, hoping that they would not inspect it. They didn’t, I got thru. This isn’t even one of the two airport instances, but it got me more nervous for the next international flights.

The first one is the flight back to Barcelona. The previous flight that checked my visa really got me scared. I was already googling for the trains and buses I could take in case they didn’t let me in the plane. The plane was delayed for more than an hour. When it finally arrived, the passengers and airline personnel were trying to move as quickly as possible. The delay worked in my favor. They didn’t bother to check anything else beside the boarding pass and the name and photo on my passport. 

## Leaving BCN

Second is when I was leaving of Spain, going to the US. I had 15 days to leave the country, starting from when the notice came out. I counted and recounted the days and booked the flight on the 14th day, giving myself an extra day as buffer, and maximizing the last days in barcelona.

Going out of barcelona, there’s a police officer (national police, I think) just before you enter the boarding for international flights. I showed my visa and TIE first. Understandably he started to get more serious as these were ofc expired. So I then showed the resolution letter. Took him a while to read it from my phone. That minute or so seemed like forever. Without saying, typing or writing anything down, he then stamped my passport and let me thru.

Before boarding, I got a cafe and bocadillo for the last time. 

## Entering NYC

Entering the US is another thing. I had to prepare things like considering which point of entry is better, having a ticket back home, having my tita write a letter that I’ll stay at her place, and booking tickets for events, all as proof that I’m just staying temporarily. In the end, the officer let me thru, I guess it was not so bad.

## To be illegal

In these circumstances, in a way, I was “illegal”.

All anxiety is calmed down by the thought of what’s the worst that could happen. Ok, so maybe I get deported.  I have always been curious if deportation can be my way back home and whether or not it’s going to be a free ride!  I was not in Trump’s America, where illegal immigrants are treated way worse (well as of writing, I am now).

## Pinoy passport

The Philippine maroon passport looks just like any other passport. The  illustrations inside portraying biodiversity and heritage are actually nice. Other than that, it is sadly one of the weakest passports in the world. 

Each and every visa process is a test of patience and "diskarte" (resourcefulness/strategy)

Never take your freedom of movement for granted.

## Reflection as luxury

The mere existence of this “work” is a luxury that needs to be recognized. It is not always that we can make the time and space for reflective activities. Yes it also takes practice and some discipline, but we often not recognize the environment that fosters it: a safe space/good place, the right mood, not being in a state of fight-or-flight.
