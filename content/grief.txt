I realize this part is not specific to being in Barcelona but I guess there is permanence in having/dealing with grief. Almost a decade since my brother Jovy passed, I have always been surrounded by a world that reminded me of him: the house, his/our things, places we usually visit. 

For 13 months, none of this materiality was there, a strange feeling.

Sharing stories of deep care, love and loss, even just parts and pieces of memories, had brought me closer to some people Iâ€™ve met. Thank you.
