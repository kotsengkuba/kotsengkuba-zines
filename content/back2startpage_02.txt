# Back to the start 2
## What now

All the future-centered thinking and the revisiting of pasts - from rizal to stories of the amazing people I met in barcelona, and how they got there - create new meaning in the present. (Ressa)

This stint in Barcelona (and nearby places) has left me a little less jaded, a little more hopeful. Maybe thatâ€™s enough.

Until then | Hasta pronto | Hanggang sa susunod
