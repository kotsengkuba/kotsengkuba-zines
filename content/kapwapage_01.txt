## Kobi’s Fam

In the last two months, I stayed with a filipino couple, Tito and Tita and their dog Kobi. They have been in spain for more than 20 years now. They arrived from different paths. Tito had been working different and multiple jobs, as he moved from different cities in the EU, he then settled in barcelona and became eligible for citizenship. Tita got hers because of a relative already residing in the city. Both of them worked hard. What is most admirable is that the are so so kind, not just to me but to many others, evidenced by frequent gifts and visits in the apartment. They’d often host small gatherings and karaoke nights. They gave a home to many in the past in their times of need, without asking much in return. Incredible cooks too. I am lucky. 

## Nay

Jokingly, I was living in IAAC. I’d arrive super early and didn’t leave until around 9pm when the man who closes the building arrives, almost always frustrated at us (with other mdefers) for not leaving sooner.

One morning before class, I was occupied taking a call. I heard “Pilipino ka?” (”Are you filipino?”). It was one of the cleaning staff. We had gotten to know each other with our chit chats whenever I arrive early to school. 

I call her  “nanay”/”nay”  (mother). She takes her work seriously. In charge of cleaning the upper floors, she makes sure that she maintained the space workable. When she came back from her vacation in the Philippines, I remember she was disappointed that the one who substituted her had not been cleaning well. On top of that, nanay has another job. Long workdays are all too familiar to filipinos.

What made me really happy was learning that she is a kakampink (supporter of Robredo’s presidential bid)! She had given donations and support back in her home province. There’s a shared trauma in that 2022 election - anger, disgust and disappointment. 

As the year went on, I’d apologize to nanay more often as we were leaving so much trash in the classroom.
