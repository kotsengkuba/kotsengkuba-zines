# Kapwa, Oddkin and the Diaspora

Millions of Filipinos leave to work or fully migrate to another country. I had always seen it from the POV of staying in the Philippines and seeing how seemingly everyone is leaving. 

The past year has put me in a pseudo state. Being a student is the in-between, a space where one can think and consider staying away. I have seen at the most personal level in my life the real struggle of filipinos in the diaspora, especially those I met in spain. It is impossible to give justice to their long journeys but to share them here is maybe a start.

## Kobi’s Fam

In the last two months, I stayed with a filipino couple, Tito and Tita and their dog Kobi. They have been in Spain for more than 20 years now. They arrived from different paths. Tito was working in the crew of a yacht and had worked different jobs . Tita got the papers because of being petitioned (for years) by their older relative. They worked hard. What is most admirable is that the are so so kind, not just to me but to many others, evidenced by frequent gifts and visits they receive.  They gave a home to many in the past in their times of need, without asking much in return. I am lucky. 

## Nay

Jokingly, I was living in IAAC. I’d arrive super early and didn’t leave until around 9pm when the man who closes the building arrives, almost always frustrated at us (with other mdefers) for not leaving sooner.

One morning before class, I was occupied taking a call. I heard “Pilipino ka?” It was one of the cleaning staff. We had gotten to know each other with our chit chats whenever I arrive early to school. 

I call her  “nanay”/”nay”  (mother). She takes her work seriously. In charge of cleaning the upper floors, she makes sure that she maintained the space workable. When she came back from her vacation in the Philippines, I remember she was disappointed that the one who substituted her had not been cleaning well. On top of that, nanay has another job. Long workdays are all too familiar to Filipinos.

What made me really happy was learning that she is a kakampink (supporter of Robredo’s presidential bid)! She had given donations back home to the campaign and given support in that ways that she can. There’s a shared trauma in that 2022 election - anger, disgust and disappointment.As the year went on, I’d apologize to nanay more often as we were leaving so much trash in the classroom.
