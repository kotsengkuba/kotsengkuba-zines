# PI100

PI means “Philippine Institutions” which is a subject in college that is mandatory by law.[see Rizal Law] As with any class in UP, it all depends on the prof you get.

## Rizal

A fun thing to do in Spain as a Filipino is to learn/relearn about Jose Rizal and the colonial period. Rizal is one of the national heroes of the Philippines (apparently wala palang official national hero). 

TLDR: Rizal, who went to Europe to study medicine, wrote novels that inspired the revolution against the spanish colonizers. Eventually leading to “independence”.

## Rizal in BCN

Rizal was arrested in Barcelona while he was his way to Cuba to provide medical help in October of 1896[see Jose Rizal Marker Montjuic]. He was imprisoned at the Montjuic castle - where many other political prisoners have been detained/tortured during the Spanish Civil War.[see Guia 2014]  Rizal was sent back to the Philippines and was executed on 30th of December of that year.

## Rizal in Madrid

There is a mini Luneta park in Madrid. Luneta in Manila is the site where Rizal was shot. On the sides of the main statue Madrid are engraved copies of his poem Mi Ultimo Adios. This poem was hidden in a lamp in his prison cell in Luneta, it was written days before the execution.[see The last days of Jose Rizal] 

## Kalyeng Rizal

In Gracia, Barcelona there is a Rizal street, Carrer Del Doctor Rizal. We can add this to the list of streets named after him. Rizal street is so common in the Philippines that just type in “Rizal street” in maps plus any province and you’ll get a result. 

## Magallanes

Oh I also learned that Magallanes = Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan failed to circumnavigate the world because he died in the Battle of Mactan in 1521 (one of those historical facts they make you memorize in civics class). It was when the Philippines was “discovered” and Spain sent more ships. The rest is history.
