# Borders

## Stay or go

Economically, staying in Barcelona or Spain made sense, with the goal of finding work and earning back all of what I spent in the year, as I didn’t get a full scholarship. Tho I got a  percentage of discount (from the “women in tech” fund that the school offered), I still had to pay the international tuition rate. This rate is twice the cost for locals and 1.5 times for those from the EU.

And then there’s the prospect of getting citizenship. It’s like a Kickstarter stretch goal. Being able to stay means working toward a spanish passport. Not to be too dramatic, but it does change the game. You suddenly unlock many borders and free f*cking healthcare for yourself and even for your family! 

From the design/creative lens, there was so much more to learn, explore and share in Barcelona. 

Positionality is important here, I have the privilege to go abroad for the “experience”, with ample stability and security. Unlike many filipinos who go as a sacrifice to provide for their families.

## To be legal

To start off/recap, the process for students going to and staying in spain is 1) to apply for and get a visa. The visa only has 3 months of validity - which is why the TIE is needed. Then, 2) to apply for and get a TIE (a foreigner identity card). Then, 3) if you want to stay in spain you can “renew”/”re-apply” for another TIE, you are given until 90 days after the TIE expires to apply without needing to leave Spain. 

In that 90-day-after-TIE-expires period, it’s not really allowed to go in and out of the country. But, there is also the Schengen thing of having open borders within the EU. This is where the grayish area lie. In July 2024, I went to France and Italy to be with family and friends, for fun basically. My TIE is set to expire in the middle of this trip. So technically, I had no valid document to justify/protect my stay in those countries. I was “illegal”.

I was fully aware of it, had done some research, and asked those I knew who’ve recently travelled. It was a mix of anecdotes, of having IDs checked or not, but there were more people who told me that they were not checked.
