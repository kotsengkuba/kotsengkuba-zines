My favorite station in Barcelona is the Gracia FCG station because of the piano there. There are also a few hospitals and recently there is one in Plaza Catalunya - which is cool because it’s digital and solar-powered. Weekly I’d go to any one these spots, but mostly in Gracia, to just play. Or sometimes just listen to others.

Once I saw a group of older ladies who brought out sheet music. They gathered around the piano at Plaza Catalunya and one of them started playing. Seemed like she was still learning the piece. But her friends were there grooving and being supportive of the process.

There were also even more magical moments where I got to interact with others and play together. Sometimes there’d be kids which made it super freestyle and fun. Sometimes with friends. Sometimes with strangers, barely understanding my poor spanish, but connecting either way.

There is one special space called Dinamo Espai, in Nou Barris, my neighborhood for most of my stay. I learned about it from Laura, one of the masters directors. I found the front door where it said “ El capitalismo es basura, la vida es otra cosa”.  Went in and met Kike, (one of) the founder(s). Dinamo is a space, a collective, an act of resistance. It’s open every thursday, so I went almost regularly and soon got to know the other frikis there.

D-I-T Do It Together 

Before, I knew nothing about synthesizers. Now, I know a little. 

The openness and the community it fosters. Just people making sound together. 

This is the kind of vibe of a space I’d like to build in the future.
