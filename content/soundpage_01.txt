# Sound

It was so fun to have sound as a theme of the main project in the masters.

## Public Pianos

My favorite station in Barcelona is the Gracia FCG station because of the piano there. There are also a few hospitals and recently there is one in Plaza Catalunya - which is cool because it’s digital and solar-powered. Several times a month I’d go to any one these spots, but mostly in Gracia, to just play. Or sometimes just listen to others.

Once I saw a group of older ladies who brought out sheet music. They gathered around the piano at Plaza Catalunya and one of them started playing. Seemed like she was still learning the piece. But her friends were there grooving and being supportive of the process.

## Beyond language

There were also even more magical moments where I got to interact with others and play together. Sometimes there’d be kids which made it super freestyle and fun. Sometimes with friends. Sometimes with strangers, barely understanding my poor spanish, but connecting either way.
