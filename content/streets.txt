## public spaces for the public
I was stunned by how Barcelona is so walkable and people  friendly. Look how wide the sidewalks are!

The streets are also safe vibrant spaces for collective movement. People here shout for accountability and peace in Palestine and Lebanon, protest against demolition of  community spaces.
